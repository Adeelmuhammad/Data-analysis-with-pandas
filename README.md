# Data-analysis-with-pandas
   Welcome to the tutorial Data analysis with pandas. In this tutorial i have covered all the topics of pandas and tried to explain each and every concepts with lesser words in jupyter notebook so that you can abserve the function of every methods in pandas from the ground level.<br>

   <br>First of all let's understand "what is data analysis and why should we use pandas for analysis ?".
   
## What is data analysis ?
   Suppose you are working in a company which daily generates a lot of data of customers and you are assigned a task to extract some useful information out of it with certain deadline. What will you do if you have very limited time you can not exract information just by looking into the dataset because size of the data is huge. So you asked for help from your collegue he said just read about pandas for data analysis. You study about pandas and you found that pandas makes your life easier than just looking at dataset and finding useful informations.
## What does pandas actually do ?
   This official documentation says- <br>
   pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.

   pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:
   * Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet.
   * Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.
   * Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels.
   * Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure.

### Dependencies-
   ```
   pip install pandas 
   pip install numpy
   ```
